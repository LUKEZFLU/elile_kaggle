## Conclusions:

- Regarding panel maintenance, one potential solution is to monitor the difference between the daily yield (within a specific time interval) and the radiation levels. We can establish a default threshold; if the difference exceeds this threshold, it indicates that the panel may require cleaning or possibly repairs. (check q2_panel_cleaning.ipynb)

- Based on their extremely high R2 values (about 99.38%), all three models demonstrate excellent data fitting. The percentage of the dependent variable's volatility that can be predicted based on the independent variables is shown by this score. The Random Forest Model has the lowest MSE value. Regarding the prediction of the future data, the Random Forest Model is a better choice.
